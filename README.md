# adminscripts
Random collection of scripts I use to make my sysoping easier.

* [nextcloud-update.sh](https://github.com/sfunk1x/adminscripts/blob/main/nextcloud-update.sh)
  * This script downloads the given version of Nextcloud and replaces an existing install with the updated package.
  * This is customized to my specific install, but can be easily changed or extended to support custom install destinations. The ecosystem is Ubuntu 22.x with [Nginx mainline](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#Ubuntu).
